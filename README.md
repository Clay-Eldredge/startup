# Smash Talk

[My Notes](notes.md)

Smash Talk is a companion tool for competitive players of Super Smash Bros. Ultimate. The primary feature will be note taking. Users can select a character to take notes on. To be better from just a normal note taking app, Smash Talk will allow users to add tags to their notes for organization and shareability. Users can search through all the notes for a specific character matchup that have been made public by other users.

You only need to fill in the section for each deliverable when that deliverable is submitted in Canvas. Without completing the section for a deliverable, the TA will not know what to look for when grading your submission. Feel free to add additional information to each deliverable description, but make sure you at least have the list of rubric items and a description of what you did for each item.

For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

- [x] Proper use of Markdown
- [x] A concise and compelling elevator pitch
- [x] Description of key features
- [x] Description of how you will use each technology
- [x] One or more rough sketches of your application. Images must be embedded in this file using Markdown image references.

### Elevator pitch

Smash players are some of the most dedicated competitive gamers out there. There is so much to learn about in the game, and players are always trying to keep track of their recently gained experience. SmashTalk will allow these players to take, post, and view notes made by others. Notes can be organized by character and move, making it easy for users to find exactly what they need. On top of that, community building features like sharing your main character, tournament results, and socials for potential requests to practice will have smash players always using SmashTalk as their smash note keeping companion.

### Design

![Design image](design.png)

The core design includes the note feed, a display showing which character page you are viewing, and text for each note (text content, upvotes, downvotes, poster, date and time).

This would be a profile page, which shows a few pieces of information (main character, discord link, win rate, and desired practice) and their recent posts.

### Key features

* posting notes that are organized by character
* logging in with a start.gg account (tournament website that keeps tournament data) to be able to see your performance against different characters
* upvoting / downvoting notes, so only the most relevant and community approved notes are shown first
* sharing your current online score (smash uses a score rather than ranking for online, so comparing scores is helpful for seeing how you place amongst all players)

### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

- **HTML** - The structure of my website. Text, images, buttons. Necessary for all pages (profile, character feeds).
- **CSS** - The styling of my website. I don't think I'll have any animations, just static styling. I need it to look professional so people will actually use it, since my website requires a userbase to be functional. I'll probably have to seed it with notes anyways.
- **React** - Dynamic front end stuff. This will handle stuff like the note feed on each character page. Also will be necessary for sorting and searching features.
- **Service** - I'll use the discord api do users can connect their discord account to their smash talk account. This will allow users to make it public, allowing message requests for practicing the character matchup. I might use the start.gg api if I have time, to add the ability to pull tournament results. 
- **DB/Login** - I'll have a database for storing the notes that are posted, and for storing account information. 
- **WebSocket** - I'll make the note feed (comments, upvotes, downvotes) update through a websocket, so you can see it update live.
